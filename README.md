# JScanner
## Description
- :warning: Before diving into my tools, read this: [NUKED](https://github.com/machineydv/machineydv/blob/master/NUKED.md)

Threaded scanning of urls mostly .js url for secrets and vulnerabilites. Scans JS even on non .js endpoint. Useful for scripting with other command while still saving to a file.

## Features
1. Concurrent scanning of all any endpoints for javascript.
2. Define your own regex in lib/Globals.py.
3. Regex for DOM XSS sinks, sources, web services, interesting variable already included.
4. Shannon entropy to catch whats missed by regex.

## Usage
```
usage: JScanner [-h] [-w WORDLIST] [-oD OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [-d DOMAIN] [-t THREADS] [-b]

Javascript Scanner

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w WORDLIST, --wordlist WORDLIST
                        Absolute path of wordlist
  -oD OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
                        Output directory
  -d DOMAIN, --domain DOMAIN
                        Domain name
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of threads
  -b, --banner          Print banner and exit

## Example
Scan a single URLs  
* ```JScanner -w <(echo 'google.com') -oD `pwd` -t 1 -d google.com```  
Scan from URLs  
* ```JScanner -w /tmp/files.txt -oD `pwd` -t 10 -d anydomainnameinfiles.txt.com```  

## Caveats
1. Only scans inline javascript when non js endpoint is given
2. May provide duplicate info (URL Skipper is in progress)
3. Output need to be improved
4. Argument to scan .js file only
5. Shannon Entropy to be implemented.
